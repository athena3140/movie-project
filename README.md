## **Movie Project UI (HTML & CSS)** 
For our final lesson together, my [tutor](https://www.facebook.com/codelab.mm) and I worked on a movie project UI using HTML and CSS. We spent a lot of time perfecting the design and ensuring that the page was fully responsive across all devices. You can check out our reference for the project design on **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/648518415072078536/?fbclid=IwAR3JxbKQ1km8Iz_BMlDFoWHIQM9-y6JRJzHALITfMFDFoWxHKuyupl-Bov0) .**
Through this project, I was able to improve my CSS skills and learn more about UI design.
